# Dialogic Event: Play Animation

Allows Dialogic timelines in Godot to play a specified Animation on an AnimationPlayer node. It can optionally make the timeline wait for the animation to finish before continuing and also hide the last dialog node during the animation.

## Installation

Simply download and place the Play Animation folder into your dialogic/custom-events folder. If you're not seeing the new event under Custom Events in the timeline editor immediately try switching timelines or reloading your Godot project.
